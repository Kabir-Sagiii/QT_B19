<h2>IntelliSense</h2>
<p>
  Visual Studio Code's JavaScript IntelliSense provides intelligent code
  completion, parameter info, references search, and many other advanced
  language features. Our JavaScript IntelliSense is powered by the JavaScript
  language service developed by the TypeScript team. While IntelliSense should
  just work for most JavaScript projects without any configuration, you can make
  IntelliSense even more useful with JSDoc or by configuring a jsconfig.json
  project.

<p>
  For the details of how JavaScript IntelliSense works, including being based on
  type inference, JSDoc annotations, TypeScript declarations, and mixing
  JavaScript and TypeScript projects, see the JavaScript language service
  documentation.
